Parking Charge Calculator

You run a car park that, at the moment, has two charging options - Short Stay and Long Stay. Visitors choose which option they want to use when they enter the car park and the charge is calculated when they leave based on the length of their visit.

The following charges are used:

Short Stay
     £1.10 per hour between 8am and 6pm on weekdays, free outside of these times. Visits need not be whole hours and can last more than one day.
Long Stay
     £7.50 per day or part day including weekends, so the minimum charge will be for one day.
     
Short list of examples:

A stay entirely outside of a chargeable period will return £0.00
A short stay from 07/09/2017 16:50:00 to 09/09/2017 19:15:00 would cost £12.28
A long stay from 07/09/2017 07:50:00 to 09/09/2017 05:20:00 would cost £22.50
